Netflix and Movies ETL

Project Description/Outline
The movie industry is monumental. Watching movies is still one of the most popular ways of spending leisure time, and Netflix has become one of the most popular movie streaming services chosen by the consumer. One would wonder what kind of budget these movies have. . .  Does it determine the success of a film? Does high budgets mean more revenue?
